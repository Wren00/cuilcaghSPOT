     and in the breeding season it has a fluttering "parachute" display flight. In winter, they are quite gregarious
     and gather in small flocks, often invisible among the vegetation, suddenly flying up with typical jerky flight. Meadow pipit numbers in the UK have been
declining since the mid-1970s, resulting in this species being included on the amber list of conservation concern.'),

    They grow from spores that are produced in fruiting bodies called capsules. When seen up close, they are very beautiful,
    but they also play an important role in the creation and continuation of peat bogs. They hold water in their spongy
    forms long after the surrounding soil has dried out, providing essential nutrients and helping to prevent the decay of
    dead plant material. It is this organic matter that gets compressed over hundreds of years to form peat.');
